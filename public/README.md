# Public Assets

This directory contains static assets that will be served as-is.

## Usage

Place static files here (images, fonts, etc.) and reference them in your code:

```tsx
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

Files in this directory are copied to the build output directory during the build process.
